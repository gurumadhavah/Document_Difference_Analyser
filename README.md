## 📈 Technical Implementation & Architecture

### Decoupled Architecture

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Backend (FastAPI)** | Handles heavy logic: diff calculation, file processing, AI API requests |
| **Frontend (Streamlit)** | Provides interactive UI with real-time updates and visual feedback |
| **Benefits** | Independent scaling, improved performance, better maintainability |

### Intelligent Diff Logic

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Algorithm** | Python's `difflib.SequenceMatcher` |
